JS Warm-Up

A small collection of JavaScript warm-up exercises and examples used to demonstrate core language concepts and browser behavior.

Project structure

- `index.html` — demo page that loads the scripts and styles.
- `index.js` — main JavaScript examples and exercises.
- `strict.js` — examples run under strict mode (`'use strict'`).
- `non-strict.js` — examples demonstrating non-strict-mode behavior.
- `styles.css` — basic styles for the demo page.
- `README.md` — this file.

Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the examples.

Notes

- The examples are intentionally small and focused on illustrating single concepts (scope, strict mode differences, DOM basics, etc.).
- Edit the `.js` files and refresh the browser to see changes.

If you'd like to add examples or improve explanations, open a pull request with a short description of the change.

This repository is intended as a personal learning playground and teaching aid.
